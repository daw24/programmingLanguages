# Homework 1  
Program reads in an input file(input.txt - a plain text file  
which contains 5 sentances), line by line anc check if the  
line read in is a pangram or not. If the sentence read is a  
pangram, it writes 'true' to the output file. If it's not, it  
writes 'false' to the output file.  
  
# Homework 2
The goal of this homework is to understand and build an interpreter  
in three languages (Python, SML, Java, 20 marks for each) for a small  
language. Your interpreter should read in an input file (input.txt)  
which contains lines of expressions, evaluate them and push the  
results onto a stack, then print the content of the stack to an  
output file (output.txt) when exit. This homework is the first of a  
multi-part homework, you will be implementing some of the features.  
More interesting features will be introduced in the following  
homework.
